Hi Everone,
I am Paul S. Ngessah, resident of Newark NJ for over 15 years.
I m married and have one daughter
Earned a Master degree from Keller Graduate Scholl of Management at Devry university
Currently work as an indepent sales contractor
This class is confusing to me at this time, because of all these diffrernt moving parts,(programs) that I have to installed. 
Confusion is a good thing, a sign of willingnes to lean something new.
I am sure I am not only having these challenges, but I say lets hang in there, everything will fall in place like a puzzle.
